**MonoDevelop 0.15** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This release contains lots of improvements, new features and bug fixes. Read below.

### Installing MonoDevelop

#### MonoDevelop Dependencies

Compiling the following order will yield the most favorable response.

-   Gtk# 2.8.0
-   Gtksourceview\#-2.0 0.10
-   Monodoc 1.0
-   Gecko\#-2.0 0.10
-   MonoDevelop 0.15 Source

You can download MonoDevelop 0.15 source from [here](/download/). The Mono download site contains packages for everything for many popular distros. You can also check the mono redcarpet channel.

This release of MonoDevelop needs at least Mono 1.1.10 to run.

### New Features

#### Configurable Key Bindings

New in this release of MonoDevelop is a configuration panel allowing users to bind custom keystrokes for commands in MonoDevelop. Built-in are both GNU/Emacs and VisualStudio.NET key-binding schemes, selectable via a drop-down menu in the configuration panel.

#### Output Pad Pinning

The output pad and the search results pad can now be "pinned", which means that their contents won't be overwritten when running a new operation. In this way it is possible to keep the output of several operations to compare results. (Lluis Sanchez)

#### Makefile Integration

The "Generate Makefiles" option now supports two types of makefiles: Autotools based makefiles (already available in previous versions), and a new simple makefile type.

Simple Makefiles don't depend on Autotools, and it may be useful for projects which don't need all features that Autotools provide, but still need to provide the most common targets such as build, install, dist and distcheck.

In addition, the support for Makefile Integration (which allows synchronizing the a Makefile with a MonoDevelop project) has improved, and now is able to automatically guess which are the variables that contain the list of project files, references, and so on.

#### Standard Header

A new Standard Header manager allows specifying the header to use when creating new files. You can write your own header, or choose one of the default headers provided. This option is available in the MonoDevelop preferences dialog, in the Standard Header section.

#### Localization add-in

The new localization add-in simplifies the work of generating and maintaining translations of projects.

The add-in provides a new type of project: a **Translation Project**. It can be added to a solution to provide localization support to all projects in the solution. Adding, compiling and updating the translations is done via the context menu of the translation project in the project browser. When running the Update command, all source files (incuding stetic guis) are scanned for GetString or GetPuralString calls, and all language files are updated. The user must only correctly initialize the translation catalog. The add-in also provides a simple .po file editor.

**Beware: this add-in is not finished and should not be used in real projects. You should consider it as a "preview".**

This add-in was started by Rafael Teixeira, and continued by David Makovský and Mike Krüger.

<h4>Text editor improvements</h4>
<p>There are some small but useful new features in the text editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many basic editor operations have now been implemented as commands, and they can be assigned to user-defined shortcuts, thanks to the new key bindings manager. (Lluis Sanchez)</li>
<li>Editor windows now have a Maximized Mode, which can be toggled by double clicking on the editor tab. In Maximized mode, the editor takes all available space of the window. (Mike Krüger)</li>
<li>The editor tab has a new context menu, which useful options such as closing all other open documents, or copying the file name. (Mike Krüger)</li>
</ul>

#### New features in the Gtk# designer

The Gtk# designer has several improvements:

-   Support for Gtk# 2.8 and 2.10 widgets, properties and events. Right now the designer only allows using widgets from the Gtk# version that is installed in the system, but it is planned to allow choosing different target Gtk# versions in following releases. (Lluis Sanchez)

<!-- -->

-   Users can now easily select which widgets are shown in the toolbox. A new widget selector will show all available widgets (by scanning all registered assemblies). When dropping a widget to the disigner, a reference to the assembly implementing the widget will automatically be added to the project. (Lluis Sanchez)

<!-- -->

-   New compact toolbox. The toolbox has a new compact view which can show more widgets in less space. (Mike Krüger)

#### Other features

-   **Assembly signing**. It is now possible to specify assembly signing options in projects. (Mike Krüger).
-   The new **Show Next/Previous** commands allow browsing through the list of errors or search results using the keyboard (they are bound to F4/shift+F4 by default). (Lluis Sanchez)
-   The New **Message Log** pad shows internal log messages generated by MonoDevelop. (Lluis Sanchez)

### Thanks

All of our wonderful testers who put up with the insane dependencies, the constant breakage and still managed to post nice bug reports.

Mike Krueger and the rest of the AlphaSierraPapa team for giving us a great codebase to start from, and continuing improvements.
