The MonoDevelop team is proud to announce the release of MonoDevelop 2.0.

MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages. MonoDevelop enables developers to quickly write desktop and ASP.NET Web applications on Linux. MonoDevelop makes it easy for developers to port .NET applications created with Visual Studio to Linux and to maintain a single code base for all platforms.

### Project Management

<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><strong>MSBuild File Format</strong>
<p>MonoDevelop now uses the MSBuild project format as its native file format. This improves compatibility with Visual Studio, and will allow MonoDevelop to transition to using xbuild/MSBuild as the build engine.</p>
<p>The old MonoDevelop project file format (mdp) is still supported. The default file format to use when creating new projects can be configured in the MonoDevelop preferences dialog, Load/Save section.</p></td>
<td align="left"><p><a href="/images/192-FileFormatSelectorSmall.png" title="File format selector"><img src="/images/192-FileFormatSelectorSmall.png" alt="FileFormatSelectorSmall.png" /><br /></a></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>New project model: Solution Folders and Workspaces<br /></strong></p>
<p>Solution folders allows organizing projects using folders inside a solution. This organization used to be done with nested solutions, but the solution folder model is more robust and it is compatible with the Visual Studio model.</p>
<p>A workspace allows grouping together a set of solutions (or other child workspaces). Workspaces are useful when you have several related but independent solutions and you want to open all of them at once.</p></td>
<td align="left"><a href="/images/193-NewProjectModel.png" title="Workspaces and solution folders"><img src="/images/193-NewProjectModel.png" alt="NewProjectModel.png" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Multiple Target Frameworks</strong></p>
<p>The .NET 3.0 and 3.5 target frameworks are now explicitly supported. MonoDevelop will now detect inconsistencies in project references. For example, a project targeting the 2.0 framework won't be able to reference projects targeting 3.0 or 3.5.</p></td>
<td align="left"><a href="/images/185-RuntimeVersionSmall.png" title="Target framework selector"><img src="/images/185-RuntimeVersionSmall.png" alt="RuntimeVersionSmall.png" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Opening Multiple Solutions</strong></p>
<p>MonoDevelop now supports opening multiple solutions at the same time. This is useful when you are working with a solution and want to review code side-by-side which belongs to another solution. To open a solution without closing the currently opened, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Open command, select the solution, and uncheck the &quot;Close current workspace&quot; option.</li>
<li>In the &quot;Recent Solutions&quot; menu, click on the solution you want to open while holding the Control key. The same applies when opening from the Welcome Page.</li>
</ul></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Configurable Project Base Directory</strong></p>
<p>All projects have a base directory assigned. This base directory is where the project file is located. All files included in the project are supposed to be under that directory, and it is the directory structure shown in the Solution Pad (files outside the project directory are still alowed, but they are shown all together in a special 'External Files' folder).</p>
<p>In order to support other project directory structures, it is now possible to specify a custom base directory for a project. So for example, now a project file can be saved in a directory and project files in a different directory. The Solution Pad will show the correct source file structure, and all version control operation will be directed to the custom base directory.</p>
The base directory can also be specified for solutions, solution folders and workspaces.</td>
<td align="left"><a href="/images/188-CustomBaseDirectory.png" title="Configurable Project Base Directory"><img src="/images/188-CustomBaseDirectory.png" alt="CustomBaseDirectory.png" /></a><br />  </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Options Dialog Reorganization</strong></p>
<p>The options dialogs have been reorganized to make it easier to find the settings to manage.</p>
<p>Configuration-specific option panels are grouped together with all other panels (configuration selection is now done inside the panel, not in the options tree), so option panels can be more logically organized.</p></td>
<td align="left"><a href="/images/189-OptionsDialogReorg.png" title="Options dialog reorganization"><img src="/images/189-OptionsDialogReorg.png" alt="OptionsDialogReorg.png" /></a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Per-Project/Solution** **Policies**

Many of the settings that were previously only available in the user's global preferences can now be set per-solution and per-project. Those settings are grouped in what we call **policies**.

Policies include:

-   Text style: tabs to spaces, tab width, etc.
-   Standard header
-   Default namespaces for projects' directories
-   Resource naming styles
-   Commit message formatting
-   ChangeLog location and formatting

Policies can be applied to solutions, and can be overridden on child projects or solution folders.

The default policies for new solutions, or solutions without policies applied, can be edited in the *Edit-\>Default Policies* dialog.

**Vala Add-in**

The new Vala project type allows managing, editing, and compiling [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) code (using valac). The compilation is configurable, including define symbols, linked libraries, custom VAPI paths and arbitrary additional arguments.

Integration with Vala's API binding system allows users to easily reference packages like SDL, DBus, or libsoup. Library projects produce VAPIs for use with Vala, as well as pkg-config files for use with C and other languages.

Class pad browsing is supported via exuberant ctags, as is limited code completion.

### Integrated Debugger

This is the first MonoDevelop release that includes support for debugging. There is support for two debuggers: **MDB** (the Mono debugger, which allows debugging managed applications), and **GDB** (which allows debugging native applications).

Here is a list of the supported features (not all features are supported in both debuggers):

-   Step by step debugging.
-   Variable and field value inspection, with support for drill-down, and value editing (with code completion).
-   Process Attach/Detach (only GDB).
-   Disassembly view, mixed with source code view when available.
-   Call stack and threads window.
-   Debug tooltip in the editor. It shows the value of variables in a tooltip, with support for drill-down and value editing.
-   Expression evaluator.
-   Support for breakpoints. Adding, removing, enabling, disabling.
-   Tracepoints, hitpoints, and conditional breakpoints (only GDB).

### Version Control

Version Control support has been improved with some new features:

-   Added support for locking/unlocking files.
-   Implemented support for the Resolve Subversion command.
-   Implemented support for the Revert to Revision command.

### Gtk# Visual Designer

-   Custom widgets can now easily be made available in the toolbox by just applying a [ToolboxItem] attribute to the class
-   Designed windows and dialogs now expose a private Gtk.UIManager field to get access to the action based UI elements.
-   Better support for moving files. When moving a window or widget implementation from one project to another project, the design will also be automatically moved
