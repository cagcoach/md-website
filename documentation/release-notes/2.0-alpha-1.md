**MonoDevelop 2.0 Alpha 1 (1.9)** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This is the first release of a series of releases that will lead to MonoDevelop 2.0, hopefully around the end of the year. This release contains lots of new features and improvements. Read below.

Installing MonoDevelop
----------------------

Compiling the following order will yield the most favorable response.

-   Gtk# 2.8.0
-   Mono.Addins 0.3.1
-   Monodoc 1.0
-   MonoDevelop 2.0 Alpha 1 Source

**It is highly recommended to use Gtk# 2.8.4 or later, since it includes important memory use and performance improvements.**

You can download MonoDevelop 2.0 Alpha 1 source from [here](/download/). The Mono download site contains packages for everything for many popular distros.

This release of MonoDevelop needs at least Mono 1.1.10 to run.

### Installing Add-ins

There are some add-ins which are distributed as separate packages. Those packages are:

-   monodevelop-boo: Boo language binding.
-   monodevelop-java: Java language binding (with IKVM).
-   monodevelop-database: database management add-in.

Other add-ins are available using the MonoDevelop Add-in Manager (in the Tools menu, click on 'Add-in Manager' and then on 'Install Add-ins').

New Features and Improvements
-----------------------------

### Project Management

#### MSBuild File format

MonoDevelop now uses the **MSBuild** project format as its native file format. This improves compatibility with Visual Studio, and will allow MonoDevelop to transition to using xbuild/MSBuild as the build engine.

The old MonoDevelop project file format (mdp) is still supported. The default file format to use when creating new projects can be configured in the MonoDevelop preferences dialog, Load/Save section.

#### New project model: Workspaces and Solution Folders

The MonoDevelop project model has been reorganized to better fit the MSBuild model, but without losing particular features that MonoDevelop used to have.

One important change is the introduction of **Solution Folders**. Solution folders allows organizing projects using folders inside a solution. This organization used to be done with nested solutions, but the solution folder model is more robust and it is compatible with the Visual Studio model.

Another change is the new support for **Workspaces**. A workspace allows grouping together a set of solutions (or other child workspaces). Workspaces are useful when you have several related but independent solutions and you want to open all of them at once.

(Lluis Sanchez)

#### Opening Multiple Solutions

MonoDevelop now supports opening multiple solutions at the same time. This is useful when you are working with a solution and want to review code side-by-side which belongs to another solution. To open a solution without closing the currently opened, you can:

-   Click on the Open command, select the solution, and uncheck the "Close current workspace" option.
-   In the "Recent Solutions" menu, click on the solution you want to open while holding the Control key. The same applies when opening from the Welcome Page.

#### Configurable Project Base Directory

All projects have a base directory assigned. This base directory is where the project file is located. All files included in the project are supposed to be under that directory, and it is the directory structure shown in the Solution Pad (files outside the project directory are still alowed, but they are shown all together in a special 'External Files' folder).

In order to support other project directory structures, it is now possible to specify a custom base directory for a project. So for example, now a project file can be saved in a directory and project files in a different directory. The Solution Pad will show the correct source file structure, and all version control operation will be directed to the custom base directory.

The base directory can also be specified for solutions, solution folders and workspaces.

(Lluis Sanchez)

#### Option Dialogs Reorganization

The options dialogs have been reorganized to make it easier to find the settings to manage.

Configuration-specific option panels are grouped together with all other panels (configuration selection is now done inside the panel, not in the options tree), so option panels can be more logically organized.

(Lluis Sanchez)

### Web Development

This new release of MonoDevelop makes editing and deploying websites easier than ever.

#### Tags in Toolbox

ASP.NET controls are shown in the toolbox for the text editor. Dragging them to the text document automatically adds the necessary assembly reference and tag prefix registration.

### Source Code Editing

MonoDevelop 2.0 will have a new text editor component written from the ground up in managed code, and this has enabled the addition of many advanced features. (Mike Krüger)

<div id="section_21">
<h4>Toolbox clipboard snippets</h4>
<p>Copied text snippets are now retained on the toolbox for later access. (Mike Krüger)</p>

#### XML Editing

The XML Editor from SharpDevelop has been fully integrated into MonoDevelop and improved. It supports code completion of tags, attributes and attribute values (available for registered XSD schemas). A range of schemas are supplied with MonoDevelop.

XML files can be validated using the built in schemas, and can have XSL transforms applied. in addition, XSD schemas can be generated from XML files.

(Matt Ward, Michael Hutchinson)

### New Tools

#### Assembly Browser

The new assembly browser allows inspecting the contents of an assembly. It can display type and member definitions, and the IL of methods.

#### Code Metrics

The Code Metrics add-in scans a project and provides basic statistics about line counts and source code licenses.

#### Pad/Document Switcher

A new pad/document switcher can be shown by pressing Ctrl+Tab.

### Integrated Debugger (Work in Progress)

Work on the debugger integration has started, and there is already basic support for step-by-step debugging, breakpoints and variable watching.

**The debugger add-in has not been included in the release because it requires Mono and the Mono Debugger from SVN.**

(Lluis Sanchez, Ankit Jain)

### Vala Add-in

The new Vala project type allows managing, editing, and compiling [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) code (using valac). The compilation is configurable, including define symbols, linked libraries, custom VAPI paths and arbitrary additional arguments.

Integration with Vala's API binding system allows users to easily reference packages like SDL, DBus, or libsoup. Library projects produce VAPIs for use with Vala, as well as pkg-config files for use with C and other languages.

Class pad browsing is supported via exuberant ctags, as is limited code completion. (Levi Bard)

Thanks
------

To all of our wonderful testers, who had the patience to use unstable versions of MonoDevelop for everyday use, and managed to post nice bug reports.

To Mike Krüger and the rest of the AlphaSierraPapa team for giving us a great codebase to start from, and continuing improvements.

To Pedro Abelleira, Todd Berman, John Luke, and other early contributors who started this adventure 4 years ago, and who believed in the feasibility of the project.

To all of the active and not so active (we miss you!) MonoDevelop developers.
