**MonoDevelop 1.0 Beta 1 (0.16)** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This release contains lots of improvements, new features and bug fixes. Read below.

### Installing MonoDevelop

Compiling the following order will yield the most favorable response.

-   Gtk# 2.8.0
-   Gtksourceview\#-2.0 0.10
-   Monodoc 1.0
-   Gecko\#-2.0 0.10
-   MonoDevelop 0.16 Source

**It is highly recommended to use Gtk# 2.8.4, since it includes important memory use and performance improvements.**

You can download MonoDevelop 1.0 Beta 1 source from [here](/download/). The Mono download site contains packages for everything for many popular distros. You can also check the mono redcarpet channel.

This release of MonoDevelop needs at least Mono 1.1.10 to run.

### New Features

#### C/C++ Support

The new C/C++ project type implemented as part of Google's Summer of Code allows compiling C or C++ code using the GNU gcc or g++ compilers. The compilation and linking is fully configurable, including warning level, optimization level, target type (executable, static or shared library), define symbols, linked libraries, library paths, include paths and arbitrary additional arguments.

Integration with pkg-config enables installed packages such as GTK+ and SDL to be easily added as references. Library projects can also export pkg-config packages for consumption by other projects or for distribution.

The class pad is fully supported (via exuberant ctags), and can be used to browse the defined symbols and jump to their declaration with a simple double-click. This also provides limited code completion in the text editor. Parameter completion works well, and completion also works for the '::' operator on classes, structs and namespaces. However, completion does not yet work for class instance members using the '.' and '-\>' operators.

Precompiled headers and dependency tracking are used to speed up the compilation process, and ccache may be used for an additional speed boost.

#### New Database Add-in

The database add-in is an improvement and partial rewrite of the old MonoQuery add-in. Some of the new features are:

-   The query view allows to limit the number of displayed results
-   The query view can import/export sql statements
-   New databases can be created
-   Support for creating tables (including constraints), procedures and views \[1\]
-   Support for altering procedures and views \[1\]
-   Support for dropping/renaming databases, tables, procedures and views \[1\]

\[1\]: Some of the features might not work or might be disabled for specific databases, this is due to missing features or bugs in the database providers. Workarounds will be implemented asap.

##### Installation

as of monodevelop beta 1, the database support is added in the main repository, to enabled it, add the "--enable-database" flag when running "./configure"

##### Database specific features

**Sqlite** (Mono.Data.Sqlite)

the Create table command is implemented, but disabled by default due to a bug in the sqlite database provider (<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=324934>), the feature will be enabled by default when the bugfix hits a mainstream mono version (probably mono 1.2.5.1 or 1.2.6)

Supported operations:

``` eval
  Create: database, view
  Alter: view
  Rename: table
  Drop: database, table, view
```

**MySql** (MySql.Data)

Supported operations:

``` eval
  Create: database, table, view, procedure, trigger
  Alter: view, procedure
  Rename: database, table, view
  Drop: database, table, view, procedure, trigger
```

**PostgreSQL** (Npgsql)

the npgsql provider distributed with mono 1.2.4 lacks supports for GetSchema ("Datatypes"), this breaks the Create Table feature

Supported operations:

``` eval
  Create: database, view, trigger
  Alter: database, view, trigger
  Rename: database, table, view, trigger
  Drop: database, table, view, trigger
```

**Sql Server** (System.Data.SqlClient) *(not yet tested)*

Supported operations:

``` eval
  Create: database, table, view, procedure, trigger
  Alter: database, view, procedure, trigger
  Rename: database, table, view, procedure, trigger
  Drop: database, table, view, procedure, trigger
```

#### Text editor improvements

The text editor has some nice improvements:

-   New move block up/down command, mapped to Alt+Up/Down (Zach Lute)

##### On-the-fly error underlining

MonoDevelop will now flag syntax errors for C# code using underlines:

![Image:Md-underline.png](/images/404.png)

Jérémie Laval contributed this feature.

##### Auto-generation of XML comment tags

The editor will now enter documentations stubs automatically after you enter "/" three times in a comment context. The generated stubs are context-sensitive which will produce the correct default of comments and for existing methods, it will also generate parameter names:

![Image:Auto-complete-anim.gif](/images/404.png)

Mike Krüger implemented this feature.

#### New ASP.NET features

ASP.NET projects now fully support the use of CodeBehind partial classes, auto-generating control references in CodeBehind classes and grouping CodeBehind classes with their parent page. They also feature new and improved templates, support for assembly references in web.config, and numerous minor tweaks and bugfixes (Michael Hutchinson).

#### Multiple Gtk# versions

MonoDevelop new supports targeting Gtk# versions other than the installed in the system. For example, in a system running Gtk# 2.10 it is possible to select Gtk# 2.4 as target version, and the generated application will be linked against the 2.4 libraries.

Support for those additional Gtk# versions must be installed using the add-in manager.

(Lluis Sanchez)

#### ChangeLog add-in

The ChangeLog add-in now allows updating several ChangeLog files in a single commit. Every project can have a ChangeLog location policy (which can be for example: create a single ChangeLog in the root project directory, one in each first-level subdirecty, or one in every subdirectory).

When committing a set of changes MonoDevelop will locate and add the comments the correct ChangeLog for every change (creating a new one if necessary).

#### Other features

-   Added regular expression library to the regex toolkit (Mike Krüger).
-   The Gettext add-in now allows choosing which projects and files to translate (Mike Krüger).
-   Added basic support for reading Visual Studio Silverlight projects (Ankit Jain).
-   Implemented new command line tool for generating makefiles (Ankit Jain).
-   Highlight missing files and directories (Eric Butler)
-   Added "Include To Project" menu item to Folders that recursively adds files (Eric Butler).
-   Gtk# designer: custom widgets now use by default the project name as category name, in this way widgets are shown in the toolbox in a more organized way (Lluis Sanchez).
-   When using a Gtk# version that supports it, MD now registers a global exception handler that will prevent MD from crashing in case of unexpected exceptions (Lluis Sanchez).

### Known Issues

-   MonoDevelop is known to have issues running on systems with **GTK+ 2.12**. In any case, feel free to try and file bug reports.
-   A bug in Mono's managed file watcher may cause the memory use of MonoDevelop to grow indefinitely. To avoid this problem make sure Inotify is properly configured like explained [here](http://www.monodevelop.com/Inotify_Watches_Limit).

### Thanks

All of our wonderful testers who put up with the insane dependencies, the constant breakage and still managed to post nice bug reports.

Mike Krueger and the rest of the AlphaSierraPapa team for giving us a great codebase to start from, and continuing improvements.

All of the active MonoDevelop developers.
